# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Logged time working on faster wpm and accuracy at https://www.typingclub.com/ . Setup the 100 days of code repository (forked from Kallaway). Walked through the GitHub hello-world tutorial (on setting up a GitHub repository/branch). Logged and closed issues. Setup a GitHub page using the tutorial: https://guides.github.com/features/pages/. Walked through the first tutorial on FreeCodeCamp (to setup account).

**Thoughts:** TBD
