**Today's Progress**: Continued tutorial on FreeCodeCamp. Currently on lesson/module 30, working on CSS styling.

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 1: April 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Logged time working on faster wpm and accuracy at https://www.typingclub.com/ . Setup the 100 days of code repository (forked from Kallaway). Walked through the GitHub hello-world tutorial (on setting up a GitHub repository/branch). Logged and closed issues. Setup a GitHub page using the tutorial: https://guides.github.com/features/pages/. Walked through the first tutorial on FreeCodeCamp (to setup account).

**Thoughts:** Put in probably 3 hours at a coffee shop; likely not sustainable but I found the FreeCodeCamp fun! So much to learn at this point that I've got a bit of shiny object syndrome.
